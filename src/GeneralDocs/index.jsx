      <p>onic apps are built using the languages of the web:
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thus, if you know how to build a basic web app,
        you already know how to build with Ionic. With Ionic, you can deploy a native
        iOS or Android app, native desktop app, or web app, all from a single, shared codebase.</p>
